# Machine Learning Stop Sign Detection In The Street

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting stop signs in street environments. The model utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning to identify stop signs from real-time video streams or images, which can be beneficial for autonomous vehicles and traffic monitoring systems.

## Features
- Stop sign detection using deep learning.
- Real-time object detection from video streams or images.
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Deployment for real-world applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python




## Results and Evaluation
- The trained model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Confusion matrix and accuracy plots are generated for analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with better datasets and hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model on edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, etc.).
- Optimize inference speed for real-time applications.
