Tools

This section outlines the tools and technologies used in the development of the Stop Sign Detection System utilizing traditional machine learning algorithms.

1.Programming Language: Python
Chosen for its extensive libraries and frameworks for machine learning, data processing, and computer vision.

2.Feature Extraction: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
Utilized for extracting key features from images to enable effective stop sign detection.

3.IDE: Google Colab
A cloud-based development environment used for writing, testing, and running Python code with access to free GPU resources.

4.Project Hosting: GitHub
Used for version control, collaboration, and hosting the project repository for public access and contributions.
